# git pull 

Similar to [git push](./Push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository. 

This means any commits that are on the remote repository will be pulled and added to the local repository.

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
git pull origin main
```

If the is a upstream connection established, you can use the `git pull`  without specifying the remote or branch.
